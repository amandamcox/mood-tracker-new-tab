# Moody - New Tab Mood Tracker

### Description
This Chrome extension overrides Chrome's New Tab page to show a custom mood tracker. The mood tracker allows you to record your daily moods and view past data easily. The saved data is synced to Chrome Storage, so the data will sync to other devices where the Google account is logged in.

### Working Demo

*This is the local version of the tool, not the new tab extension*
